[Wallpaper Generator](FlowfieldWallpaper/BookCover_Final_Origin)
-------------------
This project allows users to generate and save a wallpaper for their phone. Perlin noise was used for the design to create a path for particles to follow. The colour of the particles and the magnitude of the perlin noise path can be adjusted by the user to create a variety of interesting results.
